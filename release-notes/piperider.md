## PipeRider OSS v0.28.0

Release date: [2023-06-29](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/releases/tag/v0.28.0)

### Features

* **Run and compare command support dbt selector**: just like `dbt run -s <selector>`, you can use selector in the `run` and `compare` ([#739](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/pull/739))
* **Add cloud config to local project config**: the default cloud project config is not set to project level instead of user level. It allow you to upload to different cloud project for different dbt repositories. ([#748](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/pull/748))
* **Add metric hierarchy in the sidebar menu**: The project sidebar tree adds the metric hierarchy. ([#750](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/pull/750) [#758](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/pull/758))

### Fixes

* Make sure the dbt-helper working with the dbt-core 1.3 ([#740](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/pull/740))

## PipeRider OSS v0.25.1

Release date: [2023-05-19](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/releases/tag/v0.25.1)

* Bug fixes

## PipeRider OSS v0.25.0

Release date: [2023-05-18](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/releases/tag/v0.25.0)

Increased focus on dbt project integration.

* It's no longer required to run `piperider init` inside dbt projects, just install PipeRider and run
* The report sidebar has been redesigned to follow closely with the layout of the dbt docs sidebar, making it easier to navigate for dbt users
* Tracking schema changes: Previously, the profiling was a one-time scan of models with tags, including metadata fetching and execution profiling. Now, in the new version, we have separated the metadata collection and profiling into two distinct phases:
  1. PipeRider will gather all metadata to track schema changes for models, seeds, and sources.
  2. PipeRider will continue to profile only those models that have been tagged for profiling.

#### Feature deprecation notice

The following features are now deprecated and will be removed from a future version of PipeRider:

* Using PipeRider in **non-dbt projects**
* **PipeRider assertions**

These features are still included in PipeRider for the time being, but are not recommended for continued use.

## PipeRider OSS v0.24.1

Release date: [2023-05-04](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/releases/tag/v0.24.1)

## PipeRider OSS v0.23.0

Release date: [2023-04-20](https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider/releases/tag/v0.23.0)

* **AWS Athena Support**: PipeRider now supports querying and profiling data stored in AWS Athena.
* **Skipped model reasons**: We have added the ability to display the reason why certain models were skipped during profiling and metric queries, making it easier for users to understand and improve their data pipeline.
* **Compare Recipe Enhancements**:
  * Our Compare recipe has been enhanced to support both file and Jinja formats, allowing users to template values from environment variables for more dynamic comparisons.
  * The `compare` command now supports [comparing to a file](../get-started/compare.md#recipe-example-base-is-from-file). This means you can manually set the baseline to an existing report, and then use that in future comparisons without the need to run the baseline profile each time.
* **Other Enhancements and Bug Fixes**: We have also made several other enhancements and bug fixes, including the addition of buttons for GitHub, Discord, and documentation feedback, ensuring users have an easy and efficient way to provide feedback and suggestions for future improvements.
