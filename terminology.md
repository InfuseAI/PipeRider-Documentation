# Terminology

### Assertion Function

Assertion functions can capture critical aspects of data understanding that analysts and practitioners know based on its semantic meaning.

See also [Built-In Assertions](data-quality-assertions/assertion-configuration.md) and [Custom assertions](data-quality-assertions/custom-assertions.md).

### Assertion YAML

A `.piperider/assertions/*.yml` describes what assertion functions will be conducted against what tables/columns. See also&#x20;

### Config Yaml

`.piperider/config.yml`  is a project configuration file containing data sources and dbt integration settings. Generated by `piperider init`. See also [Project Structure](project-structure.md).

### Connector

Enables PipeRider to connect to a variety of data sources, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, Snowflake etc.

Also known as data source connector. See also [Data Sources](broken-reference).

### Credential Yaml

`.piperider/credentials.yml` saves credentials used by connectors for the connection establishment. See also [Project Structure](project-structure.md).

### Custom assertion

Users can extend basic assertion with application-or domain-specific expectations to build the customized assertion functions. See also [Custom Assertions](data-quality-assertions/custom-assertions.md).

### Compare reports

Capability to compare the output of runs in a static HTML page. See also [Compare Reports](how-to/compare-reports.md).

### Data quality

It is a perception or an assessment of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context.

### Data source

Provides a standard API for accessing and interacting with data from a wide variety of source systems, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, Snowflake etc.

### Profiling run

The act of generating metrics and candidate assertion from data. The executions of a run over a time period is to generate profiling results for each run at `.piperider/outputs/`. See also [Project Structure](project-structure.md).

### Report

A static HTML report based on a profiling result in a visual manner at `.piperider/reports`. See also [Project Structure](project-structure.md) and [Generate Report](how-to/generate-report.md).
