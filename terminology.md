# Terminology

###

### Config file

A YAML file is located at `.piperider/config.yml` and used for storing project configuration such as available data sources and dbt integration settings. Generated by `piperider init`.

See also [Project Structure](about-piperider/project-structure/).

### Connector

Also known as **data source connector**.

Enables PipeRider to connect to a variety of data sources, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, etc.

Types of connector and data source integrations:

* [Postgress Connector](code-review-for-data/install-piperider/supported-data-sources/postgres-connector.md)
* [SnowFlake Connector](code-review-for-data/install-piperider/supported-data-sources/snowflake-connector.md)
* [dbt Integration](code-review-for-data/dbt-integration/)

### Credentials file

A YAML file located at `.piperider/credentials.yml` that is used for storing credentials used by connectors to connect to data sources.

See also [Project Structure](about-piperider/project-structure/).

### Compare reports

Capability to compare the output of runs in a static HTML page.

See also [Compare Reports](how-to-guides/compare-reports.md).

### Data quality

It is a perception or an assessment of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context.

### Data source

Provides a standard API for accessing and interacting with data from a wide variety of source systems, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, etc.

### Metrics

In dbt, you can define [metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics), which are an aggregation over a table and can be used to display the most important metrics (e.g. weekly active users, total revenue).

### Profiling run

The act of generating metrics and recommended assertions from a data source. The execution of a run over a time period is to generate profiling results for each run at `.piperider/outputs/`.

See also [Project Structure](about-piperider/project-structure/).

### Report

A static HTML report that is generated based on the results of a profiling run and is stored in `.piperider/outputs/`.

See also [Project Structure](about-piperider/project-structure/) and [Generate Report](how-to-guides/generate-report.md).
