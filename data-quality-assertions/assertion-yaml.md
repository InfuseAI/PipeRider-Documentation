# Assertion Files

Assertion files are located in  `.piperider/assertions/`  and are created as part of the `piperider init` process.

### File naming convention

Assertion files are YAML files and are named according to the data source table name:

&#x20; `<table>.yml`&#x20;

If you opted to generate 'recommended assertions' during `piperider init`, then assertion files will be prepended with 'recommended\_':

`recommended_<table>.yml`&#x20;

### Types of assertions

PipeRider comes with a set of [built-in assertion](assertion-configuration.md) tests and also includes functionality to create [custom assertion](custom-assertions.md) tests.

### Verifying assertion file formatting

After editing assertion files, use `piperider diagnose` to verify the format.

### Example assertion file

The following is an except of an assertions file for a movie database table:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by PipeRider based on table "movies"
movies:  # Table Name
  # Test Cases for Table
  tests:
  - metric: row_count
    assert:
      gte: 8961
    tags:
    - RECOMMENDED
  columns:
    title:  # Column Name
      # Test Cases for Column
      tests:
      - name: assert_column_schema_type
        assert:
          schema_type: VARCHAR
        tags:
        - RECOMMENDED
      - name: assert_column_not_null
        tags:
        - RECOMMENDED

```
