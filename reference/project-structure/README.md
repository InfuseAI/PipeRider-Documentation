# Project Structure

When initializing a new PipeRider project, a folder called `.piperider` will be created in the root of your project.

After using the various features of PipeRider this folder will become populated with the following files and folders.

| File/Folder name | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| config.yml       | The project config file containing data source and dbt integration settings. Generated by `piperider init`.                                            |
| credentials.yml  | The data source connection parameters and credentials. As this file may contain sensitive credentials, committing it to source control is not advised. |
| assertions/      | Contains data assertion files for data source tables. Please see [assertion configuration](broken-reference).                                          |
| plugins/         | Contains custom assertion definition files. Please see custom assertions                                                                               |
| outputs/         | The data profiling and the report output generated by `piperider run`                                                                                  |
| comparisons/     | Reports generated by `piperider compare-report`                                                                                                        |
| .gitignore       | The default `.gitignore` file. Generated by `piperider init`. Please see [git versioning](./#git-versioning).                                          |

### Git Versioning

Piperider projects are designed to source-controlled in a git repository. The generated `.piperider/.gitignore` is our recommended way to ignore files and folders in git.

The default `.gitignore` file contains the following files and folders.

```
**.log
__pycache__/
logs/
outputs/
reports/
comparisons/
credentials.yml
.unsend_events.json
```
