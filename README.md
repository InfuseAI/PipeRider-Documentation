# What is PrimeHub?

**PrimeHub** is a _Kubernetes-based_ platform designed for groups of data scientists. It aims to be an all-in-one, enterprise-level, machine learning platform that provides a seamless MLOps experience.

PrimeHub adopts a group-centric design, which accelerates collaborative development. In PrimeHub, scientists can share datasets, artifacts, and seamlessly collaborate on projects in groups. Models can be developed, deployed, and monitored with full control in a transparent group environment.

Using PrimeHub’s granular controls, administrators can configure access control settings, manage resources, and adjust resource quotas for groups - All facilitating efficient resource utilization.

With the addition of 3rd-party app integration, PrimeHub’s capabilities can be augmented on demand, accelerating the machine learning workflow. These 3rd-party apps also benefit from the access control and resource configurability that is available through PrimeHub, making for a true, all-in-one, MLOps solution.
