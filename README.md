## What is PipeRider?

**PipeRider** is a data quality toolkit for data professionals. With PipeRider you can profile your data sources, create highly customizable data quality assertions, and generate insightful reports.

Ensuring consistent quality of data used to be difficult. Missing values, schema changes, data drift (to name just a few), could be introduced to your data at any time. Without effective data quality tools these errors will affect downstream operations and result in countless lost hours to debugging and missed revenue opportunities from unexpected downtime.

PipeRider allows you to define your expectations of the data once, and then use data assertion testing to alert you to changes in your data quality.

## The Concepts behind PipeRider

PipeRider is a non-intrusive data reliability platform with reporting.

The concept of PipeRider is to enable you to better **understand your data** through [data profiling](data-profile-and-metrics/data-profile.md), and **ensure the quality of your data** by testing the [data profile metrics](data-profile-and-metrics/metrics.md) with [data assertions](data-quality-assertions/assertion-configuration.md). It is through this process of profiling and testing that PipeRider provides a platform for data reliability.

PipeRider should work with your **existing data sources**, and require **minimal configuration** to set-up and use. This is demonstrated through PipeRider's automatic detection of dbt projects and recommended assertion generation.

The **command line tool** should be **useful for data engineers**, while the **reporting output** should be visually appealing and **useful to non-DE stakeholders**.
