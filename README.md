## What is PipeRider?

**PipeRider** is a data quality toolkit for data professionals. With PipeRider you can profile your data sources, create highly customizable data quality assertions, and generate insightful reports.

Ensuring consistent quality of data used to be difficult. Missing values, schema changes, data drift (to name just a few), could be introduced to your data at any time. Without effective data quality tools these errors will affect downstream operations and result in countless lost hours to debugging and missed revenue opportunities from unexpected downtime.

PipeRider allows you to define the shape of your data once, and then use the data checking functionality to alert you to changes in your data quality.
